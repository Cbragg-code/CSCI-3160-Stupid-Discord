Set up VS Code
-	Download WSL extension pack
-	Log in to WSL normally through the command line. Go to the directory you want to be in. Enter >$ code .
    - this should open a WSL instance in VS code
    - you can also start wsl from vscode but I think this is easier 
-	Download python extension pack (VS code will probably suggest them). Even if you already have them downloaded on your machine, you have to download them again in WSL
-	Open a terminal in VS code. This works the same as the normal command window.
    - Ctrl+Shift+P then use the View: Toggle Terminal command
- Enter >$ sudo apt-get install python3-tk into the terminal (to get gui manager)
- Configure the python interpreter (bottom right corner)
- To run python, you don't have to compile or anything. >$ python3 filename.py runs a py script
- Make sure to update the value LIBRARY_PATH to the filepath of my_functions.so. my_functions.so is recompiled upon program start, so you will not have it in your directory on the first run. 

Gui user guide
To run the gui, all you have to do is put the files below into your folder, set up py libraries, 
set up a server on port 9001, and then run  >$ python3 Chat.py or >$ python3 LogIn.py

- LogIn.py: run this first if you want to enter a custom username (already working) and port number (under construction)
  If you don't want to do this every time, I have defaults already set up in Chat.py
  After you do that and press join, it will close the window and launch Chat.py

- Chat.py
  Called by LogIn, or you can run it by itself
  Dependent on clientTest as a library 
  This is the file that creates a gui and then manages library calls to the client C code
  to actually run the chat 

- guiClient.c
  Modified client code, broken up into functions and changed slightly.
  To use it, you have to run cc -fPIC -shared -o my_functions.so guiClient.c
  Chat.py does this automatically every time you run it, but if you change the file and then test
  it in another program, you have to compile it into the .so again.

- server.c to open the server. The server must be open for the client to connect.
